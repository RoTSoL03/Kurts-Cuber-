# Kurts-Cuber-
Hello this is Stephen Kurt! and I am trying to learn game development using javascript. I am confident enough to create a simple 2d game, so I have decided to challenege myself
to create a 3d game using javascript.

At first this game is very greuling to work with as a begginer, and I have realised that there are so many steps I have skipped before learning how to make 3d games.

in this code/program/game I have used Three.js to help me better develop a simple 3d game.

Now this game is inspired by beat saber and geometry dash combined, now adding both of them together sounds fun!

This game has took me a long time to develop as I am still learning the basics, there will be many flaws and bugs but I hope you will enjoy my basic cuber game!
